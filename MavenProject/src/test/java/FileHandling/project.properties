# create a .properties file and put everything that is constant like URl,
# has a key value pair
key=value
username=Praisa
username=Bidur    
password=anything
URL=https://gmail.com

#if we have 4 test cases and we need to use to URL four times in 4 test cases
# in future if we need to change the URL to something else then we need to open the java file and change
# the URL in the test cases. So its better we dont hardcode the URL in the testcases. We put the URL in the
#properties file and just mention the key-value pair key in the TCs.
# Every TCs will read from the properties file.
